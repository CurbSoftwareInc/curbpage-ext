# CurbPage Browser Extension Privacy Policy

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy outlines how the CurbPage Browser Extension handles user data. The extension is designed to simplify web navigation by allowing users to create custom navigation menus and save SQL queries as relative URLs.

## Compliance with User Data Policy
The CurbPage Browser Extension is compliant with the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy. It is designed with a focus on user privacy and security, ensuring that any user data handled is done so securely and transparently.

## Data Handling
The extension does not collect, transmit, use, or share any personal or sensitive user data. It operates entirely within the user's browser without transmitting data externally.

## Personal or Sensitive User Data
The extension does not handle any personal or sensitive user data as defined by the policy, including personally identifiable information, financial information, health information, authentication information, website content and resources, form data, or web browsing activity.

## Privacy Policy Requirements
- **Information Collection**: The extension does not collect any user data. All operations are confined to the user's local browser environment.
- **Usage of Information**: As no data is collected, there is no usage of user data.
- **Sharing of Information**: No user data is collected or shared.

## Encryption and Data Security
The extension does not handle user data, hence, there is no transmission of personal or sensitive data that requires encryption. However, should any future updates include such features, appropriate encryption protocols (e.g., HTTPS, RSA, AES) will be implemented.

## Prominent Disclosure and Consent
Since the extension does not handle personal or sensitive user data unrelated to its core functionality, no prominent disclosure or affirmative consent is required as per the current operations.

## Changes and Updates
This policy may be updated to reflect changes in our practices or in response to regulatory changes. Any modifications will be communicated through appropriate channels.
